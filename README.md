# Detecting Fraudulent Transactions using Neural Networks

This Cuny Tech Prep Project involves comparing other machine learning modelswith our designed Neural Network.
 This project contains the dashboard used to showcase our model, the dashboard was implemented using streamlit and its associated libaries.

 You can implement this code locally.
It is advised that you create a virtural enviorment to prevent side effects on you local machine. To deploy the app locally, use python```streamlit run Objective.py```


This app is also delpoyed on the web for your convinence as well.
